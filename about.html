        <h2>How it <em>really</em> works</h2>
        <h3>Electronick Servitors</h3>
        <p>
          Traditionally a servitor is a spirit that is conjured by a human
          wizard/witch in order to do their bidding. What we present here is an
          experiment in chaos magic. We use the <i>hot new technology</i> of
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model"
            >LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS</a
          >
          to create a literal digital servitor that will process your words of
          intention.
        </p>
        <p>
          That's all it does. Just as you might meditate on your desired reality
          in order to manifest it, so too will this servitor take your words and
          "meditate" on them. Your words are repetitively given to it as a
          prompt to expand on. In this way we utilize the immense processing
          power available to us in this modern age, for magick.
        </p>
        <h3>Example</h3>
        <p>Say your intention is</p>
        <p class="prompt">
          "John Doe is charismatic".
        </p>
        <p>
          ServitorAI will take this and expand on it for a few thousand words.
          producing for example:
        </p>
        <p class="prompt">
          ... John Doe is charismatic. He exudes confidence, and this confidence
          is infectious, making those around him feel more at ease and inspired
          to be their best selves. He is not arrogant or entitled, but rather he
          is unapologetically himself, and this authenticity is deeply
          attractive. John Doe is charismatic. He is a natural people person,
          and he thrives in environments where he can interact with others,
          listening actively and responding thoughtfully. He is an excellent
          communicator, able to convey his ideas and thoughts in a clear and
          concise manner, making him an effective leader and collaborator. ...
        </p>
        <p>It will then do this for <b>tens of thousands of words</b> a day, depending on your setting, effectively writing a few books in the process.</p>
        <h3>Philosophy</h3>
        <p>
          Is the AI sentient? Does it matter? Or does it matter more to your own
          subconscious to know that your words are being processed somewhere by
          some other entity? As with any magick, who knows? It seems to be just
          another edition of the classic "assuming the world is out there"
          blind. Based on various magical, mystical and tantric traditions, the
          underlying fabric of spirit is a subtle energy field. Often described
          as literal electricity / magnetism. And so, we allow you to extend
          your subconsciousness with this electronic servant.
