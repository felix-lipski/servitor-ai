        <h3>
          Is my data safe?
        </h3>
        <p>
          Yes!
          <ul>
            <li>We use Supabase for authentication and storage. It's a very well established and secure service, trusted by the likes of Mozilla and 1Password.</li>
            <li>The project is open source, you can find the code <a href="https://github.com/felix-lipski/servitor-ai">here</a>.</li>
            <li>We don't use any third party tracking, analytics or sell your data. We are strictly opposed to how the modern internet works.</li>
            <li>In case you're still wary, you can always formulate your intentions in a more private way by replacing any sensitive information with nicknames, initials or simple "my master"/"my mistress".</li>
            <li>You can read our <a href="privacy.html">privacy policy</a> for more details.</li>
          </ul>

        <h3>
          Do I need to do my manifestations also? Or do I need to forget about
          it entirely, like with a sigil?
        </h3>
        <p>
          We would like to encourage an active approach. But this is just a tool
          and a pretty new one at that. We're also only figuring it out. Use it
          as you see fit. We don't claim to know any one true technique.
        </p>
        <h3>
          Doesn't a servitor usually require a some sort of sacrifice?
        </h3>
        <p>
          Indeed, here the cost is monetary. This sort of computation is also quite energy intensive, on the technical side.
        </p>
        <h3>
          I can just write to a ChatGPT for free every day to the same effect...
        </h3>
        <p>
          On a technical level, this is just a website + cronjob + LLM.
          Depending on your skill you could set up a personal version
          of this over a weekend. You would still need to pay for the AI compute
          or electricity to use it. What we offer is a ready fire-and-forget
          service at a reasonable rate.
